# Welcome to my Resume Website!

My name is Andrea Pascual, and I am a current UCR student! 

CS008 has been teaching us the basics in website building, and in coding, so I'm excited to show you the finalized product!

This final website has been the accumulation of a full quarter of work, so I hope you enjoy!
